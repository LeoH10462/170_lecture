    "\n",
    "Have you ever seen a sign near a storm drain that says \"No Dumping - Drains to Ocean\"? If you live inland, you might have seen one that says Drains to River, Lake, Bay, or Waterway. All of these are messages about the same thing—anything washed or dumped into the drain will be transported downstream and has the potential to pollute local waterways and the larger water bodies they connect to. For example, pollution carried down the Mississippi from Midwestern farms has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of Massachusetts where fish and plants have to fight for survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to find the area that drains to a storm drain, and the route that pollutants will take if they are dumped or washed into the drain. You'll find the upstream drainage area, called a watershed, for a storm drain near [a location of your choice] . Then you'll find the downstream flow path to where it empties into the Gulf of Mexico or another body of water. Knowing how to find these, you can experiment to find the watersheds and flow paths from other storm drain locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses Spatial Analysis online service tools, **Create Watershed** and **Trace Downstream**, that perform analysis on your web GIS. You can find more information about the Create Watershed analysis tool [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/analysis/api-reference/create-watersheds.htm) and the Trace Downstream analysis tool [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/analysis/api-reference/trace-downstream.htm)."
